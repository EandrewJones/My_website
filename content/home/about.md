# Bio

I'm a PhD student in Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I study the economic and media dimensions of Chinaâ€™s growing influence and reactions to them by states and individuals. A China scholar by training and a mathematician at heart, my research agenda combines field interviews, archival materials, and case studies with machine learning, text analysis, and surveys. 

A native of Michigan, I grew up traversing the Great Lakes. Since then, I have moved on to bigger adventures. Prior to grad school, I trekked across the Pacific Northwest and Canadian Rockies, American Southwest and Northeast, and mainland China. My goal is to one day visit all 56 US national parks.
