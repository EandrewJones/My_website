# Bio

These days, I do not keep this site up to date. I keep it hosted to retain links to statistical software and workshops I've built over the years. Surprisingly, some people still contact me about them.

I'm currently a full-time Software Engineer at the Applied Research Lab for Intelligence and Security. Prior to that I was a PhD student in Government and Politics at the University of Maryland, College Park until I decided to dropout about 75% of the way into my dissertation to pursue software engineering. Zero regrets. As a PhD student, I studied the economic and media dimensions of Chinaâ€™s growing influence and reactions to them by states and individuals. A China scholar by training and a mathematician and programmer at heart, my research agenda combined field interviews, archival materials, and case studies with machine learning, text analysis, and surveys.

A native of Michigan, I grew up traversing the Great Lakes. Since then, I have moved on to bigger adventures. Prior to grad school, I trekked across the Pacific Northwest and Canadian Rockies, American Southwest and Northeast, and mainland China. My goal is to one day visit all 56 US national parks.
