I introduce some of the basic packages and tools available in the R language for web scraping and interfacing with APIs. Particular attention is paid to understanding the structure of websites and how they operate so that participants feel comfortable extrapolating beyond the presented examples to their own use cases. Instructions for installing the package are available [here](https://github.com/gsa-gvpt/gvpt-methods/blob/master/webscraping/README.md)."
